        <p class="members__description">We are ADA University first- and second-year SITE students. Our team number is 28. The name of our website is ADA Digitalium. We selected it since we are in the technological age right now, so let's digitize. Despite the majority of individuals saying that the previous generation was superior than the current one. We need to prove the contrary of it. To build our website, we studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a joy to work on such an excellent task together. We fairly distributed the jobs among ourselves, and we all performed the ones that were given to us.</p>
